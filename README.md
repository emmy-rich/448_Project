## Prototype

This prototype uses the [NWS Weather API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) to generate a random outfit and reminders based on the temperature of Lawrence, KS.

In order to run the prototype locally on your machine, you need to have the latest version of node so that fetch will work. 
Then clone it down to your machine and navigate to the Prototype directory. 
To run the prototype use the command: `node index.js`


**This was tested on Mac, no Windows instructions at this time**
