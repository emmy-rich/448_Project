## Prototype

This prototype uses the [NWS Weather API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) to generate a random outfit and reminders based on the temperature of a users zipcode.

In order to run the program locally on your machine, clone this repo down to your machine. If you are a linux user, clone from the main branch and if you are a mac user, clone the mac branch.
To run the prototype use the command: `node index.js`


**This was tested on Mac and Linux. There are no Windows instructions at this time.**
